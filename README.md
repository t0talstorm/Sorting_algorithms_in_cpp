# EXPERIMENT - SORTING ALGORITHMS IN C++

## Aim: To study and implement various sorting algorithms in C++ and analyze their performance characteristics.

## Apparatus: VS Code or Online C++ Compiler

## Theory:

**Sorting** is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science, involving the arrangement of data elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). Sorting algorithms are essential building blocks for many other algorithms and are crucial for optimizing data retrieval, searching, and processing operations. Understanding different sorting techniques helps in choosing the most appropriate algorithm based on specific requirements such as data size, memory constraints, and performance needs.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Sorting Algorithm**: A method that arranges elements in a specific order.
   ```cpp
   void sortArray(int arr[], int n) {
       // Implementation varies by algorithm
       // Goal: Rearrange elements in ascending/descending order
   }
   ```

2. **Time Complexity**: Measure of how the algorithm's execution time grows with input size.
   ```cpp
   // O(n²) - Quadratic time complexity (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
   // O(n log n) - Linearithmic time complexity (Quick Sort average case)
   ```

3. **Space Complexity**: Amount of extra memory space required by the algorithm.
   ```cpp
   // O(1) - Constant space (in-place sorting)
   // O(log n) - Logarithmic space (recursive algorithms)
   ```

4. **Stability**: Property where equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting.

### Sorting Algorithm Categories:

1. **Comparison-based Sorting**: Algorithms that sort by comparing elements
2. **Non-comparison Sorting**: Algorithms that don't rely on element comparison
3. **In-place Sorting**: Algorithms that require only O(1) extra memory
4. **Stable Sorting**: Algorithms that preserve relative order of equal elements
5. **Adaptive Sorting**: Algorithms that perform better on partially sorted data

### Algorithm Classification:

```cpp
// Internal Sorting: All data fits in main memory
void internalSort(int arr[], int n) {
    // Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
}

// External Sorting: Data too large for main memory
void externalSort(string filename) {
    // Merge sort with disk-based operations
}
```

### Performance Analysis Metrics:

- **Best Case**: Minimum number of operations required
- **Average Case**: Expected number of operations for random input
- **Worst Case**: Maximum number of operations required
- **Space Complexity**: Additional memory required
- **Stability**: Preservation of relative order
- **Adaptability**: Performance on partially sorted data

### Benefits of Understanding Sorting:

- **Algorithm Design**: Foundation for understanding algorithmic complexity
- **Data Processing**: Essential for efficient data manipulation
- **Search Optimization**: Sorted data enables binary search (O(log n))
- **Database Operations**: Critical for database indexing and query optimization
- **Real-world Applications**: Used in graphics, compression, and data analysis

### Common Sorting Challenges:

## Programs:

### 1. Selection Sort Algorithm

---

**File:** `Selection_sort.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SORT-01

**Description:** Implements selection sort algorithm that finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning. This algorithm demonstrates the concept of repeatedly selecting the smallest element and building the sorted array incrementally.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialize**: Start with the first element as the current position
2. **Find Minimum**: Scan the remaining unsorted array to find the minimum element
3. **Swap Elements**: Exchange the minimum element with the element at current position
4. **Advance Position**: Move to the next position and repeat until array is sorted
5. **Termination**: Continue until all positions are processed

**Time Complexity:**
- **Best Case**: O(n²) - Always performs n² comparisons
- **Average Case**: O(n²) - Consistent performance regardless of input
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) - Same performance for all input distributions

**Space Complexity**: O(1) - In-place sorting algorithm

**Key Learning:** Understanding basic sorting principles, minimum element selection, and consistent time complexity regardless of input order.

### 2. Bubble Sort Algorithm

---

**File:** `Bubble_sort.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SORT-02

**Description:** Implements bubble sort algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in wrong order. The algorithm "bubbles" larger elements toward the end of the array through successive passes, with optimization for early termination when no swaps occur.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Outer Loop**: Control the number of passes through the array
2. **Inner Loop**: Compare adjacent elements in current pass
3. **Compare and Swap**: If adjacent elements are in wrong order, swap them
4. **Optimization**: Use a flag to detect if any swaps occurred in current pass
5. **Early Termination**: If no swaps in a pass, array is already sorted
6. **Boundary Reduction**: Reduce comparison range in each pass as larger elements settle

**Time Complexity:**
- **Best Case**: O(n) - Array already sorted (with optimization)
- **Average Case**: O(n²) - Random order of elements
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) - Array sorted in reverse order

**Space Complexity**: O(1) - In-place sorting with only a few extra variables

**Key Learning:** Understanding adjacent element comparison, optimization techniques, and how simple algorithms can be improved with early termination strategies.

### 3. Quick Sort Algorithm

---

**File:** `Quick_sort.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SORT-03

**Description:** Implements quick sort algorithm using divide-and-conquer strategy. The algorithm selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays. This demonstrates advanced concepts like recursion, partitioning, and efficient average-case performance.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Base Case**: If array has 1 or 0 elements, it's already sorted
2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose the last element as pivot (or use other strategies)
3. **Partitioning**: Rearrange array so elements ≤ pivot come before it, elements > pivot come after
4. **Recursive Calls**: Apply quick sort to sub-arrays on both sides of pivot
5. **Combine**: No explicit combine step needed as sorting happens in-place

**Partitioning Process:**
- Maintain index of smaller elements
- Traverse array and swap elements ≤ pivot to the left side
- Place pivot in its correct final position
- Return pivot index for recursive calls

**Time Complexity:**
- **Best Case**: O(n log n) - Pivot divides array into equal halves
- **Average Case**: O(n log n) - Random pivot selection performance
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) - Pivot is always smallest or largest element

**Space Complexity**: O(log n) - Recursive call stack space

**Key Learning:** Understanding divide-and-conquer paradigm, recursion in sorting, partitioning strategies, and how pivot selection affects performance.
